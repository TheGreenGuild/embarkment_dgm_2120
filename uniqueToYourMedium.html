        <h2>Mediums</h2>
            <p>Each medium has unique strengths and weaknesses associated with them. Learning to take advantage of 
                your medium's special strengths and how to avoid it's weaknesses can be one of your most powerful 
                tools in storytelling.<br>In <a href="#film_header">film</a> for example, you can easily show a silent
                 expression exchanged without dialigue by two characters and imply what they are thinking. Typically you 
                 cannot <i>hear</i> what they are thinking though. It is a-typical to have a voice over of their thoughts, 
                 but in a book hearing a characters thoughts will not draw a second glance from the audience.</p>
        <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>Writing is awesome because it's easier than other mediums to choose a viewpoint style and narrative 
                closeness. A fantastic resource is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BrandSanderson" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson's YouTube page</a> 
                where he has posted many of his lectures from a course he teaches at BYU University. His lectures 
                are longer (hour plus) and each one ranges in topics. 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EllenBrock" target="_blank">Ellen Brock</a> a freelance editor 
                on YouTube also has a great page with smaller bite sized videos on specific topics if you're 
                looking for something more specific.</p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Total freedom</li>
                <li><b>No budget constraint.</b> Props and set are all made by the reader. You can literally 
                    make anything happen. No CGI needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The reader is always reading words so it's harder to use "silent moments" between 
                    characters like movies can do.</li>
                <li>Harder to use color for thematic elements than visual mediums.</li>
                <li>No use of music.</li>
                <li>Easier to disregard the importance of getting other's input. With film for example you 
                    naturally get input as part of a team.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2 id="film_header">Film</h2>
            <p>Film is amazing beacuse you can <i>show not tell</i> which is an old addage in story 
                telling. You can lean on (or be hindered by) an actor's performance as well.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Silent moments</dt>
                <dd>Dialogue can stop for a moment and purely visual story telling can take over for a moment.</dd>
                <dt>Parallel Action</dt>
                <dd>Cutting back and forth quickly between two scenes simultaneously is much easier to 
                    accomplish in this medium than in written form.</dd> 
                <dt>Visual Cues</dt>
                <dd>Certain visual cues such as color, facial expressions, and high/low camera angles 
                    can convey meaning in ways that pure dialouge or description may not be able to convey 
                    as easily or at all.</dd>               
            </dl>
                <h4>Strengths</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use of visual story telling elements such as color music etc.</li>
                    <li>Use of acting, lighting, music and other elements to reinforce a script.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be more time consuming.</li>
                    <li>Lots more budget, skills or resources to pull off correctly.</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Film</h2>
            <p>Film is amazing beacuse you can show not tell which is an old addage in story telling. 
                You can lean on (or be hindered by) an actor's performance as well.</p>

                </ul>
            <h2>Webtoon</h2>
                <p>A quickly growing medium with low barrier to entry on the website. Anyone can submit their 
                    work for free and use Webtoon's tools to enhance their page.</p>
                    <h4>Strengths</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keeping digital copies of your work means you have the potential to convert it to 
                            a physical graphic novel later.</li>
                        <li>Possible to have fans contribute via GoFundMe links.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not selling anything directly.</li>
                        <li>Audience can only grow so big using this one online platform.</li>
                    </ul>
